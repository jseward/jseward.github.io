[Sins of a Dark Age Bug 904](https://github.com/IroncladGames/SinsOfADarkAge/issues/904)

This bug is due to somehow match searches continuing to run on the servers while still playing a match. There are a lot of moving parts among various servers for match making. A user can queue for any number of match types which is a combination of region, game type (siege or duel), and queue type (normal or scrimmage, ranked in the future). Probably the most important variable and the one that causes the most trouble is the interaction between scrimmage and normal matches. The idea is that scrimmage matches are just for fun short games to play while waiting for a normal longer match. Anyone can leave a scrimmage match at anytime. Your match searches for normal matches will continue while playing the scrimmage match. The opposite is not true though. Normal matches are not leavable and will stop all other match searches. The combination of these rules along with all the ways match searches can be started/stopped/restored among various servers causes much pain.

So back to the bug. Luckily Manny the god veric has tracked down all the necessary information I need (GameId and AccountId).

There is lots of information here but I've highlighted the important line causing this bug. What happens is that when scrimmage games are finished the desired behavior is for an automatic re-queue for scrimmage games without modifying the searches for normal games. Otherwise uses would have to stop and start searching manually to get in another scrimmage game while waiting for their normal game.

So in this case the player was playing 2vs2 scrimmage games while waiting for a 5vsAI or 5vs5 normal game. There are a few false starts where assembly of the 5vsAI game does not complete, but finally one does complete right when the 2vs2 scrimmage game is ending. The player gets into the 5vsAI game. This deactivates all match searches for the account as it is a non-scrimmage game. But then the scrimmage game ends around the same time causing a re-queue action which then activates all the match searches again. (this is bad)

So from a high level point of view the fix seems pretty easy, if we joined a normal game then simply prevent re-queuing of scrimmage games (purge the string from Redis). But there are a few implementation gotchas. If a normal 5vsAI match starts there is no guarantee it will actually finish being assembled. Other players might not accept or timeout. In this case match searches need to be activated again. You can see this in the screen shot where a MatchSearch is activated again due to the Reason:Requeue:AbortedGameMatch:xxx. If the scrimmage to scrimmage re-queue was blocked in this window of time the player would be left in a state of having no scrimmage searches anymore. And would rightfully hate the game for buggy matchmaking.

A more robust solution is to treat all re-queuing equally.

- re-queuing scrimmage games after a scrimmage game finishes
- re-queuing match searches if game assembly fails 
- re-queuing match searches if or a player exits the lobby before the game starts 

Every match search now tracks WHO deactivated them. And since a match search can be deactivated multiple times in different contexts this needs to be a set of MatchSearchIds. Then the rule for re-queuing is that if you are the one and only one who deactivated the match search, you are allowed to reactivate it. This allows various forms of re-queuing to come in any order and the last one will properly re-queue.

Here is the new code path for re-queuing that everything shares.

public MatchSearchingState ReactivateAllLinkedMatchSearches(
	long linkRootMatchSearchId, 
	string reason)
{
	Tracing.TraceMatchSearchEvent(
		linkRootMatchSearchId, 
		"ReactivateAllLinkedMatchSearches {0}", 
		StringHelpers.JoinParams("reason", reason));

	var manifestId = (long)Database.HashGet(
		Keys.HashMatchSearch(linkRootMatchSearchId), 
		HashFieldNames.MatchSearch.ManifestId);
	
	var allMatchSearchIds = Database.SetMembers(
		Keys.SetMatchSearchIdsOfMatchSearchManifest(manifestId)).ToLongArray();

	var activeMatchSearches = new List<MatchSearch>();

	foreach (var matchSearchId in allMatchSearchIds)
	{
		if ((bool)Database.HashGet(
			Keys.HashMatchSearch(matchSearchId), 
			HashFieldNames.MatchSearch.IsActive))
		{
			activeMatchSearches.Add(GetMatchSearch(matchSearchId));
		}
		else
		{
			var reactivateAllowedMatchSearchIds = Database.SetMembers(
				Keys.SetReactivateAllowedMatchSearchIds(matchSearchId)).ToLongArray();
			
			//NOTE: must be the one and only one allowed matchSearchId
			//for reactivation. Consider a casual match search that got 
			//deactivated for both a casual match formed AND a normal 
			//match formed. Then around the same time the causal match 
			//game finishes (requeue) AND the normal match assembly 
			//fails (requeue). Whichever one comes last should be the 
			//one that actually reactivates.

			bool canReactivate = 
				reactivateAllowedMatchSearchIds.Count() == 1 &&
				reactivateAllowedMatchSearchIds.Contains(linkRootMatchSearchId);

			if (canReactivate)
			{
				ReactivateMatchSearch(matchSearchId, reason);
				activeMatchSearches.Add(GetMatchSearch(matchSearchId));
			}
			else
			{
				Database.SetRemove(
					Keys.SetReactivateAllowedMatchSearchIds(matchSearchId), 
					linkRootMatchSearchId, 
					CommandFlags.FireAndForget);
			}
		}
	}

	return MatchSearchingState.New(
		GetStartTimeOfMatchSearch(linkRootMatchSearchId),
		activeMatchSearches);
}
