[Sins of a Dark Age Bug 904](https://github.com/IroncladGames/SinsOfADarkAge/issues/904)

This bug is due to somehow match searches continuing to run on the servers while playing a found match. There are a lot of moving parts amongst various servers for match making. A user can queue for any number of match types which is a combination of region, game type (siege or duel), and queue type (normal or scrimmage, ranked in the future). Probably the most important value and the one that causes the most trouble is the interaction between scrimmage and normal matches. The idea is that scrimmage matches are just for fun short games to play while waiting for a normal longer match. Anyone can leave a scrimmage match at anytime. Your match searches for normal matches will continue while playing the scrimmage match. The vice versa is not true though. Normal matches are non-leavable and will stop all other match searches. The combination of these rules along with all the ways match searches can be started/stoppped/restored amongst various servers causes much pain.

Ok, so back to the bug. Luckily Manny the god veric has tracked down all the necessary information I need (GameId and AccountId).

There is lots of information here but I've highlighted the important line causing this bug. What happens is that when scrimmage games are finished the desired behavoir is for an automatic requeue for scrimmage games without modifying the searches for normal games. Otherwise uses would have to stop and start searching manually to get in another scrimmage game while waiting for their normal game.

So in this case the player was playing 2v2 scrimmage games while waiting for a 5vsAI or 5vs5 normal game. There are a few false starts where assembly of the 5vsAI game does not complete, but finally one does complete right when the 2vs2 scrimmage game is ending. The player gets into the 5vsAI game. This deactivates all match searches for the account as it is a non-scrimmage game. But then the scrimmage game ends around the same time causing a requeue action which then activates all the match searches again. (this is bad)

So from a high level point of view the fix seems pretty easy, if we joined a normal game then simply prevent requeuing of scrimmage games (purge the string from Redis). But there are a few implementation gotchas. If a normal 5vsAI match starts there is no guarantee it will actually finish being assembled. Other players might not accept or timeout. In this case match searches need to be activated again. You can see this in the screenshot where a MatchSearch is activated again due to the Reason:Requeue:AbortedGameMatch:xxx. If the scrimmage to scrimmage requeue was blocked in this window of time the player would be left in a state of having no scrimmage searches anymore. And would rightfully hate the game for buggy matchmaking.

The problem really comes down to not enough information being kept on WHY match searches were being deactivated. If I know why match searches are deactivated I can safetly reactivate the appropriate match searches. So in this example if the scrimmage match searches are deactivated firstly just because we are in a scrimmage match. Then I know when the scrimmage ends that these scrimmage match searches can be reactivated. BUT if a normal game starts and overwrites why the match search is deactivated with 'in-normal-match' then I know that when the scrimmage ends that they can't be reactivated.




                    platformClient.PushSessionMessage(
                        MatchSearchStartedNotifyMessage.New(requeueResult.MatchSearchingState),
                        requeueResult.AccountIds);
