What I really need to track is WHO deactivated a particular match search. And handle multiple deactivations properly. In this case.

Scrimmage2vs2 Match Search (A)

Deactivated by Scrimmage2vs2 (A) - upon the scrimmage match forming
Deactivated by Normal5vsAI (B) - upon normal match forming
Attemp Reactivated by Scrimmage2vs2 (A) - auto requeue upon scrimmage match ending, do nothing here as deactivated by both A and B, remove reference to A
Attemp Reactivated by Normal5vsAI (B) - upon normal match assembly failing, requeue here as only deactivated by B now

Normal5vsAI Match Search (B)

Deactivated by Normal5vsAI (B) - upon normal match forming
Attemp Reactivated by Scrimmage2vs2 (A) - upon scrimmage match ending, do nothing here as not deactivated by A
Attemp Reactivated by Normal5vsAI (B) - upon normal match assembly failing, requeue here
